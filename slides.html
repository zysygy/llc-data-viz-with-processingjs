        **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is a _style sheet_ language used to create the presentation and look of a site.

        <p class="example css">I'm a paragraph with <span style="colour:purple;">style</span>.</p>

        **JavaScript** is a _programming_ language used to define the behaviour and used to add functionality to a website.

        # JavaScript is a Programming Language

        Since JavaScript is a programming language, the structure and syntax include more complexities than HTML or CSS.

        The basic building blocks of programming include features such as *variables*, *functions*, *objects*, and control structures such as *if* statements and *loops*.

        * Open Source, free for everyone to use
        * Still JavaScript at its core

        ProcessingJS ***is*** JavaScript so it's important to have an understanding of some basic JavaScript principles first.

        Also, note that programming languages often require a little bit more code than HTML & CSS to see results in the browser.

        #The Console

        Before we get into the nitty-gritty details of these JavaScript principles, let’s take a look at a tool called the console.

        We'll be using this tool in the upcoming exercises to focus on getting used to the programming syntax.

        The console allows us to write programs without relying on HTML & CSS and learn some of the fundamental programming concepts first.

        The console in Chrome looks like this:
        ![The Console](framework/img/workshop/the_console_x.jpg)

        **Important!** The blue `>` symbol represents a space to enter your input but you don't have to actually type the symbol.

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Accessing the Console

        You can open the console when viewing _any_ HTML page. In Chrome, there are different ways to open the Console tab.

        Keyboard shortcut:

        Windows:  `CONTROL + SHIFT + J`

        Mac: `COMMAND + OPTION + J`

        If you prefer the mouse: `⋮ > More Tools > Developer Tools`

        Open the console in this slide presentation. Take a moment to practice opening and closing the console until you’re comfortable with it.

        ---

        ###Pro tip!
        The console also shows any errors on the page so if you open the console on any existing web page, you *may* see some error messages.

        # Class Exercise: Working with Numbers

        In the console, after the `>` symbol, type your favourite number and press the enter/return key. You will see something like this:

        ![console number](framework/img/workshop/console-number.gif) <!-- .element: width="85%" -->

        The ```>``` symbol represents a space for your input.
        The ```<``` symbol represents the **returned value** of your input.

        ---
        ###Pro tip!
        To increase the font size of the console, use `Command/Control +`.
        Use  `Command/Control 0` to return it back to the default size.

        You can also input text, BUT make sure you include it between quotes

        Text you work with in most programming languages is called a **string**  (more on this soon).

        The command you input into the console gets *evaluated* and a value is returned back to you.

        * gives a *name* to a *value*.

        A variable is a named memory location which contains information, to be used at a later time.

        ```javascript
        var myVariable = "Hello!";
        ```

        The value `Hello` is given to the name `myVariable` and is declared using the keyword `var`. This is *assigning* a value to the *variable*.

        Evaluate everything to the right of the equals sign, then assign the value to the variable on the left of the equals sign.

        What does this store?

        #Class exercise: Using Variables

        When using the console tool, it will automatically return a value when you input an instruction. Declaring a variable just *stores* the value until you're ready to use it.

        `var favFood` is just holding on to the value, so it returns nothing (undefined). But now, JavaScript knows it exists.

        To actually **use** the variable, just type `favFood` into the console. It will now **return** the value that it was storing and look something like this:

        ```javascript
        > var favFood = "pizza";
        < undefined
        > favFood;
        < "pizza"

# Variable Types: Strings and Quotes

Strings values can be wrapped in either 'single quotes' or "double quotes." You can use either style but you must start and end the string with the same mark.

But be careful! In the example below, this will cause an error.

```javascript
var fails = 'This string's value is not going to work!';
/*          ^           ^
            |___________|
            |
            Javascript thinks the second apostrophe closes the first.
            It then expects the command to end with a semicolon (;)
            right after and returns an error.

        ```

        Or *escape* it by using a backslash.

        JavaScript can also do math.

        `+` addition, `-` subtraction, `*` multiplication, `/` division

        ```javascript

        # Exercise: Create a JavaScript Program! (~10 mins)

        Using variables & arithmetic operators, calculate how many seconds there are in a day.

        (You can choose your own variable names. Just make sure to adhere to best practices.)<!-- .element: class="note" -->

        1. Declare variables & values for:
          * `secondsPerMinute`
          * `minutesPerHour`
          * `hoursPerDay`
        1. Declare a `secondsPerDay` variable and use arithmetic operators to calculate the value.
        1. **Bonus!** Use concatenation to output "There are x seconds per day."

        var secondsPerDay = secondsPerMinute * minutesPerHour * hoursPerDay;

        // This command will output the value of secondsPerDay
        secondsPerDay;

        // Concatenating strings with the secondsPerDay variable.
        var sentence = "There are " + secondsPerDay + " seconds per day.";

        #Comments!

        Just like HTML and CSS, you can also leave comments in JavaScript.

        ```
        // This is how you leave a single line comment.

        // You can write many single line comments.
        // Just make sure to add the double slash
        // for every new line.
        ```

        Here's another way to comment larger blocks of text.

        ```javascript
        /* This is how you leave
        multi-line comments for when you
        want to write a longer message */
        ```

        Multi-line comments are great for "hiding" large blocks of code so you can try something new without erasing your old code.

        # Variable Types: Booleans

        Variables that only contain a `true` or `false` value are called **booleans**.  You can set values to `true` or `false`.

        OR
        ```javascript

        # Variable Types: Objects

        **Objects** can be thought of as a variable that can hold *multiple* values. To *declare* an object, use the curly brackets `{}`.

        The values are written in `property: value` pairs. Each pair is separated by a comma, except for the last one.

        ```
        var myObject = {
          propertyName: propertyValue,
          anotherPropertyName: anotherPropertyValue
        }

          milk: "almond",
          flavour: "caramel"
        }
        ```

        ```

        * the property name must start with a letter and contain no spaces
        * a colon (:) is used to separate name from value
        * a comma (,) separates properties
        * can be repeated for as many properties as you like
        * the last pair of `property:value` does not end with a comma

        As you've just seen, there are *many* different variable types in JavaScript and many rules about how to write them.

        There are actually a few more. You can read all about them [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures).

        A `function` is a name for a **set** of commands or instructions.

        When using a function, it executes all the commands contained within, making it easier to make redo the same steps.

        Let's look at two functions, `alert()` and `prompt()`.  These come built into JavaScript, for free! Note the syntax, the parentheses `()`, must be included.

        We've seen now that `alert()` and `prompt()` create a pop-ups in the browser but the pop-ups are blank.  An *argument* can be *passed* into the functions by adding a value within the parentheses `()`.

        Try this in the console:

        ```
        alert("Hello!");
        ```

        ```
        prompt("What day is it today?");

        ```javascript
        function sayAnything(){

          prompt("What day is it today?");

        `alert()` is a **function**, it works on its own.

        `log()` is a **method** because it's attached to an **object**, `console`. It will log a message only into the console tool.

        A function is one of the most powerful tools in programming. ProcessingJS, as it turns out, is a giant object with a whole pile of functions available to us.

        Remember, ProcessingJS is a **JavaScript library**.

        It's a collection of functions/methods that let you leverage the work others have done.

        You can download it and use in your projects. There's a lot more to JavaScript, but this intro will help to get up and running with ProcessingJS!

        # Getting started

        Let's open *starter.html* in Atom and try making a ProcessingJS app from scratch. You should have a basic HTML document to start.

        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head>
          <title>My First ProcessingJS project</title>
        </head>
        <body>

        </body>
        </html>

        ```

        The first step is telling your web page how to read ProcessingJS commands, which means **importing** the library.

        Put the following code inside the `< body>` tags. **Be sure to save your changes!**

        ```

        < canvas id="myProcessingProject">< /canvas>

        < script src="processing.min.js">< /script>

        ```

        **Note**: You don't need a space after the first `<` and `canvas` or `script`. It's been done only in these slides for formatting reasons

        We add the `< canvas>` element to hold all of our ProcessingJS output. Instead of drawing HTML elements, we're going to be drawing to the canvas.

        The `src=` does the import and give us access to all the functions ProcessingJS has to offer. You can find **processing.min.js** in the projects folder with the files you downloaded.

        Now try loading the page in the browser and see what you get.

       #Setting up ProcessingJS for the first time

        Now that you have your `< script>` tag to import ProcessingJS, you can add another set of `< script>` tags to form foundation for ProcessingJS.

        Copy the following code into your file
        ```
        < script>
          function sketchProc(processing) {
            processing.setup = function() {
            //the code for your basic setup functions goes here
            }
            processing.draw = function() {
            //The code to describe what you want to draw goes here.
            };
          }
          var canvas = document.getElementById("myProcessingProject");
          var processingInstance = new Processing(canvas, sketchProc);
        </ script>
        ```

        1. We make a function called `sketchProc` which is where we'll do most of our work to draw things. Right now it contains starter methods, `setup()` and `draw()`. More on these later.

        2. We create our `canvas`. Just like with real art, the canvas is where we'll be actually drawing stuff.

        3. Finally, we add the "instance" of ProcessingJS and connect it to our `canvas` and `sketchProc`. An instance is basically a copy of the program you want to run.

        You can have more than one instance of ProcessingJS just as you can open more than one Word document at the same time.

        ```
        var canvas = document.getElementById("myProcessingProject");
        ```

        This goes and gets your canvas element, saving the HTML element into a new variable called "canvas."

        ```
        var processingInstance = new Processing(canvas, sketchProc);
        ```
        This starts up a new ProcessingJS program and sends it two things: Your canvas, and the name of the function that will control how it behaves.

        This sends us back to the top of our sketchProc function to do some setup tasks:

        ```javascript
        function sketchProc(processing) {
            processing.setup = function() {
              //the code for your basic setup functions goes here
              processing.size(700,500);
            }
            processing.draw = function() {

            };
          }

        sketchProc() is the name of our function that controls how our canvas behaves.

        #Setup() and Draw()

        Let's break down what's happening so far.

        `setup()` is only run once and is the first thing ProcessingJS runs. It does the basic construction, sets the size and background colour of the canvas, and any other configurations that should be present by default.

        The `draw()` method includes everything that's added on top of the initial state created by `setup()`. In our case, that includes drawing a rectangle on top of our canvas background.

        ```
        function sketchProc(processing) {
            processing.setup = function() {
              //the code for your basic setup functions goes here
              processing.size(700,500);
            }
            processing.draw = function() {
              //The code to describe what you want to draw goes here.
              processing.rect(10,20,130,260);
            };

      #The Draw method

      Just as we explored earlier, `draw()` is how ProcessingJS that actually puts stuff on your canvas.

      The `draw()` method is not static, though. It is constantly drawing to the screen, updating 60 times per second, or once every 16.66 milliseconds. The constant updating and redrawing is how animation or movies work.

      Right now we've only drawn a single rectangle, but we'll see later how this can be changed on the fly.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>

        #Understanding Coordinates

        A lot of the elements you draw in ProcessingJS will use a coordinate system to tell them where they should be. We've already seen this in action when we made our rectangle.

        ```
          processing.rect(10,20,130,260);
        ```

        Put in another way

        ```
          processing.rect([Starting X position],[Starting Y position],[Width],[Height]);
        ```

        If you think of the whole canvas, the position `(0,0)` is in the **top-left** corner.

        Our rectangle with starting position of `(10,20)` has its top-left corner 10px to the right of the left side of the canvas and 20px below the top of the canvas.

        The lower-right corner of the rectangle extends 130px from the X start position, and 260px from the Y start position.

        Similarly, try adding an ellipse:

        ```
         processing.ellipse(50, 50, 25, 25);
        ```

        The first set of coordinates is the center of the ellipse (x and y) and the second two numbers are how tall and wide it is.

        Go ahead and try playing around with these numbers and see the effects. Remember to **save and refresh** the page each time!

        #Getting more complicated

        Up to now, we've known in theory that the `draw()` function runs 60 times per second and can be used to animate your visualizations, but with our current `rect()` doesn't make use of it yet.

        Let's update `draw()` to make it a little more dynamic.

        #Exercise: Showing Some Growth (code-along)

        Now that we can draw rectangles, let's make them grow in size. Let's go open *index.html* inside the *GrowingRectangleChallenge* folder

        JavaScript let's you establish global variables that can start off as one value, but can be adjusted as the program runs.

        Start by adding these two variables just inside your `sketchProc` function:

        ```
        function sketchProc(processing) {
          var width = 10;
          var height = 20;
          ⋮
        ```

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Exercise: Showing Some Growth (cont.)

        We've set some variables for the dimensions of the rectangle, but how do we use them for our rectangle?

        Recall how we made our first rectangle and what each number represents

        ```
          processing.rect(10,20,130,260);
          processing.rect([Starting X position],[Starting Y position],[Width],[Height]);
        ```

        What should we do with `width` and `height`?

        `processing.rect(10,20,width,height);`<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

        We just insert them into the values we use to make our rectangle!<!-- .element: class="delayed" -->

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Exercise: Showing Some Growth (cont.)

        The next trick is realizing that variables can be updated after they've been set, which is part of why they're so useful.

        After the rectangle creation in your `draw()` function, you can include this:

        ```
          width = width + 0.1;
          height = height + 0.2;
        ```

        Save your changes and refresh the page to see what happens.

        Remember that `draw()` updates 60 times a second. With our new code, we're telling ProcessingJS to increment the `width` and `height`, which occurs with each update and changes the shape of our rectangle.

        You can adjust the numbers to change how quickly your rectangle grows.

        # Order of operations

        Let's look back at that ellipse we started drawing earlier.

        ```
        processing.ellipse(50, 50, 25, 25);
        ```

        Add that right after your `rect()` inside your draw function to make your draw function read like this:

        ```
        processing.rect(10,20,width,height);
        processing.ellipse(50, 50, 25, 25);
        width = width + 0.1;
        height = height + 0.2;
        ```

        Now run your app.

        Notice that the ellipse is always on top of the rectangle. Every time `draw()` updates, it draws the rectangle **then** draws the ellipse on top as that's the order the code is given.

        Flip the order of the ellipse and the rectangle to see what happens.

        # Working with colour

        The `processing.fill()` method allows you to set the fill colour of any element you draw on your canvas. Once you set `fill()`, though, it applies to all draw commands that come after it. All colour values are supplied as RGB values.

        ```
        processing.fill(255,0,0);
        processing.rect(10,20,width,height);
        processing.ellipse(50, 50, 25, 25);
        ```

        The above makes both the rectangle and the ellipse bright red.

        Try this instead:

        ```
        processing.fill(255,0,0);
        processing.rect(10,20,width,height);
        processing.fill(0,255,0);
        processing.ellipse(50, 50, 25, 25);
        ```

        This makes a red rectangle and a green ellipse on top of it.

        Similarly, in `setup()` you can set `processing.background()` with RGB values to shift it away from this dull default gray.

        ```
        processing.background(15,200,80);
        ```

        You can use a [colour picker](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) to help you figure out the RGB values for the colours you want to display.

        # Adding interactivity

        One of the easiest ways to add interactivity to your ProcessingJS visualization is by tracking mouse movements over the page (or finger presses, as is often the case). ProcessingJS comes with a few methods that help with this.

        ```
          var mouseXposition = processing.mouseX;
          var mouseYposition = processing.mouseY;
        ```

        `mouseX` and `mouseY` represent X and Y coordinates of where the mouse is currently pointing. We can use these coordinates when drawing our shapes.

        Let's make a circle that tracks our mouse movements.

        In your `draw()` function, adjust your ellipse command to:

        ```
          processing.ellipse(processing.mouseX, processing.mouseY, 25, 25);
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Well that was weird

        The circle repeated itself all over the page! Goodness, that's not what we want.

        ProcessingJS repeats the `draw()` function 60 times per second, but it was never told to clear away the stuff it drew in the past. Each circle gets drawn and left behind as we move our mouse.

        The fix this, add this one line to the top of your `draw()` command.

        ```
          processing.background(15,200,80);
        ```

        This line resets the background of your app each cycle, effectively "wiping" the canvas each time and makes for a much cleaner experience.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # If statements in ProcessingJS

        The other part of what you can do inside your `draw()` function is write `if` statements: conditionals that test all 60 times per second to see if they should run one way or the other.

        We'll use a conditional now to set a cap on how much our rectangle can grow.

        Replace your current width and height incrementing code with this

        ```
        if (height >= 480) {
          console.log('all done');
        } else {
          width = width + 0.1;
          height = height + 0.2;
        }
        ```

        To break it down:

        ```
        if (height >= 480) {
            console.log('all done');
        ```

        Here we check on the current update of `draw()` if the height is greater or equal to 480px.

        If so, we do nothing since we've reached our max size and want to stop growing. We print a message to the console that we can check later.

        ```
        else {
          width = width + 0.1;
          height = height + 0.2;
        }
        ```
        Otherwise, we perform the same code as before, growing the size of the rectangle.

        **Tip:** We use 480 because our canvas is 500 pixels tall and we start the rectangle 20 pixels from the top. 500 - 20 = 480

      </script>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown data-toc>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Behavioural IF statements

        You can also use `if` statements to test where the user's mouse is and define behaviour based on that position.

        For example, you could test to see if the circle you're positioning around the mouse is inside the box, and change the colour of either the circle or the box because of that position.

        This extensive list of conditions (four of them, one for each side of our square), asks if the mouse is inside the boundaries of our rectangle.

        ```
        if (processing.mouseX > 10 && processing.mouseX < (width + 10) && processing.mouseY > 20 && processing.mouseY < (height + 20)) {
          processing.fill(255,0,0);
        } else {
          processing.fill(0,0,255);
        }
        ```

        **Tip:** We use the +10 and the +20 on the conditions to accomodate the starting position of our rectangle, otherwise we would be measuring from the top corner of our canvas, not the top corner of our rectangle.

        2. Make the rectangles fill with colour, but only when the mouse is inside them. Choose [any colour](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) you like

        3. Make a circle follow your mouse, but only when the mouse is inside a rectangle. Size and colour are up to you

        Stretch goal: What if the size of the circle changed based on where the mouse was positioned?

        #Exercise answer

        1. Here's a guaranteed way to choose coordinates that won't overlap

          * Pick a set of coordinates along with width and height eg. **(10, 20, 100, 200)**
          * Calculate where the **bottom-right** corner will be by adding the width to X and the height to Y. eg. (10 + 100, 20 + 200) -> **(110, 220)**
          * For the second rectangle, choose X and Y such that at least one of them is greater than the corresponding value from the previous step. eg. (115, 100), (30, 300), and (150, 250) are all fine
          * Choose the width and height for this second rectangle, as long as it will still fit in the canvas

        2. To check that the mouse is inside one of the rectangles, we compare the `mouseX` and `mouseY` against the four boundaries of where the rectangles will be. We set up a couple of big `if` statements with multiple checks. After that, we just choose our colour before drawing our rectangle.

        3. We can squeeze the drawing of the circle into the box colouring and drawing since we care about the same condition: being inside one of the rectangle. Just make sure to change the `processing.fill` right before you draw the circle!

```
      if (processing.mouseX > 10 && processing.mouseX < (width + 10) && processing.mouseY > 20 && processing.mouseY < (height + 20)) {
      processing.fill(255,0,0);
      processing.rect(10,20,width,height);
      processing.fill(0,255,0);
      processing.ellipse(processing.mouseX, processing.mouseY, 25, 25);
      } else {
      processing.fill(0,0,255);
      processing.rect(10,20,width,height);
      }

      if (processing.mouseX > 10 && processing.mouseX < (width + 10) && processing.mouseY > 80 && processing.mouseY < (height + 80)) {
      processing.fill(0,255,0);
      processing.rect(10,80,width,height);
      processing.fill(255,0,0);
      processing.ellipse(processing.mouseX, processing.mouseY, 25, 25);
      } else {
      processing.fill(0,0,255);
      processing.rect(10,80,width,height);
      }
      ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Stretch goal answer

        Remember that `mouseY` is just a number at the end of the day.

        Coordinates are also just numbers, so we can plug in `mouseY`.

        `25 + (processing.mouseY / 3)`

        The 25 is our base value, the smallest we want the circle to be. Then we add the mouseY to it. The `/ 3` is just to make the difference less jarring, but you can pick whatever you like.

        ```
        processing.ellipse(processing.mouseX, processing.mouseY, 25 + (processing.mouseY / 3), 25 + (processing.mouseY / 3));
        ```

        #Telling processing how to access the data

        ProcessingJS comes with a method that allows you to read data from a text file and store it in a variable.

        We don't want to do this every single time the `draw()` function runs, 60 times per second, we just want to do it once at the top of the program so we don't spend so much energy reading data.

        We can do this before we even run our `setup()` function:

        ```
          var myData = processing.loadStrings('data.txt')
          var mailChimpData = myData[0].split(',')
          console.log(mailChimpData);
        ```

        This is steps. The first step is to grab the text data. Then we need to actually split it into an array so we can treat each value in it separately.

        The `split()` function allows you to specify the comma as the separating character, splitting each value from each other using the commas.

        The `console.log()` at the end allows you to see the final list of data, presented as a nice clean array.

        #Looping through your data

        Once you import your data, you can draw different shapes on your canvas in accordance with your data. You can also control the size of those drawings by using the data as attributes like "width" and "height."

        As before, you should create a `setup()` function that will establish the base of your canvas:

        ```
          processing.setup = function() {
            //the code for your basic setup functions goes here
            processing.size(700,500);
            processing.background(0,0,0);
          }

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Looping through your data

        Now, just like the last example, we can setup a draw() function that will loop 60 times per second to draw our data.

        ```
        processing.draw = function() {
          //The Code you want to draw in goes here.
          processing.background(0,0,0);
           for (var i = 0; i < mailChimpData.length; i++) {
            processing.fill(255,255,255);
            processing.ellipse(100, 100, mailChimpData[i], mailChimpData[i]);
           }
        };

        ```

        This places five circles of varying widths directly on top of each other, with the centres of each of them at 100 pixels in from the left, and 100 pixels down from the top.

        Enter: The stroke values.

        ```
        processing.stroke(255,255,255);

        We want our circles to all live next to each other, not on top of each other. Friendly neighbours, not roommates.

        So in our loop, we can change the center of each circle individually by adding another variable. Before the loop starts -- inside your draw() function but outside of the loop drawing your circles -- add this variable:

        ```
        var toTheLeftToTheLeft = 75;
        ```

        Then you can change your `ellipse()` command to include that variable on the x-axis -- the horizontal axis.

        ```
        processing.ellipse(toTheLeftToTheLeft, 100, mailChimpData[i], mailChimpData[i]);
        ```

        Then, at the bottom of your loop, change that variable for the next circle in line to be drawn.

        ```
        toTheLeftToTheLeft = toTheLeftToTheLeft + 130;

        Of course it is.

        This part is a little complicated, but if you place this function just above your setup() function, but inside your sketchProc() function, you can test to see if your cursor is inside each circle.

        ```
        function overCircle(CenterX, CenterY, diameter) {

          processing.stroke(255,0,0);
        } else {
          processing.stroke(255,255,255);
        }

        ```

        This tests, 60 times per second, if your cursor is inside the circle. If it is, it draws a red stroke. If it's not, it draws a white stroke. Handy!

        # Labels

        It's starting to look really great. Now let's just add some labels so we know what we're looking at.

        Working with text in ProcessingJS is super easy. There's a method called text() that handles all the text you need to place in your graphic, as well as it's positioning. All in one go.

        So before you adjust your toTheLeftToTheLeft variable, but after you add your ellipsis, add these two lines:

        ```
        processing.fill(255,255,255);
        processing.text('Test Text', toTheLeftToTheLeft - 25, 200);
        ```

        We add the -25 so that we can backtrack the text to center it under the circle. The 200 is how far from the top of the canvas the text is. "Test Text" is the text that will actually appear in your graphic.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Labels that mean something

        Instead of "test text" it would be helpful if our text described the circle it was under. To do that, we'll need an array of labels to use, in the same order as our circle data.

        So if our circle data is:

        ```
        231,85,87,16,2
        ```

        Then our labels need to be:

        ```
        deliveries, bounces, opens, clicks, unsubscribers
        ```

        So at the top of your sketchProc() function, where you set up your data import, you can add this one line to establish your labels:

        ```
        var labels = ['Deliveries', 'Bounces', 'Opens', 'Clicks', 'Unsubscribers']
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown data-toc>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Add the right labels

        Now instead of "Test text" you can insert your appropriate label. Change your text() command to:

        ```
        processing.text(labels[i], toTheLeftToTheLeft - 25, 200);

        ```
        The labels[i] will refers to master array of labels at the top of the program, and the i refers to the loop through your circle construction.

        So just as your app builds its first circle, it grabs its first label. As it builds its second circle, it grabs the second label. And so on.

        Loops are great.
